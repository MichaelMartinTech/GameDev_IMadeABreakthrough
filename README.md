## Game Overview

**Genre**: Strategy (Turn-Based/Abstract Strategy)  
Breakthrough challenges players to outmaneuver their opponent's pawns and reach the boardâ€™s back row. The game features two modes:
- **Classic Mode**: Deliberative gameplay with no time limits.
- **War Mode**: Main game mode; Fast-paced gameplay with timed turns and an AI opponent with consistent adaptation.

Players can compete against a dynamic AI opponent or another human player.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Advance your pawns to the opponent's back row while blocking their progress.
2. **Controls**:
   - Click to select a pawn and choose its movement (forward, diagonal-left, or diagonal-right).
   - In War Mode, make decisions quickly within given time constraint.
3. **AI Gameplay**:
   - Adjust difficulty through game settings for learning the basics or competitive gameplay.

## Key Features

### Technical Highlights
1. **Minimax Algorithm**:
   - Implements a robust AI system for decision-making.
   - Evaluates potential moves (forward, diagonal-left, diagonal-right) based on board state and prioritizes strategic actions, such as attacking or advancing.
   - Adaptive depth for challenging gameplay.
2. **Dynamic Game Logic**:
   - Efficient board management and piece interactions.
   - Asynchronous AI calculations for ideal transitions between turns.
   - Interactive move highlights and attack animations.
3. **Sound & Effects**:
   - Custom-coded sound management integrated with the Unity engine.

### Creative Contributions
- **Art & Animation**:
  - Minimalist pixel-art style designed for clarity and engagement.
  - Fluid animations for pawn movement and interactions, leveraging Unity's tweening capabilities.
- **Music & Sound**:
  - Original background music composed in a retro synth style.
  - Dynamic sound effects, such as destruction, movement, and victory, enhance the player experience.
  - Custom sound engine integrated into the gameplay for reactive audio transitions.

### Interpretive Aspects
- Designed with player behavior and decision-making in mind; AI adapts playstyle to challenge users effectively.
- Explores themes of competition and adaptability in strategic environments.
